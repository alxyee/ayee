                 What's more challenging than playing the notorious game flappy bird? A: Playing flappy bird just by using your feet! For Maker's Faire 2014, we decided to connect our smart insoles with flappy bird the game. This project involved connecting external pressure sensors embedded in the insoles to a phone using Bluetooth Low Energy.

                We created custom pressure sensors using conductive thread and piezoresistive materials, aka velostat. The sensors were then covered with a layer of inert felt which made for a very cheap, flexible and durable e-textile sensor. During Maker's Faire we got a lot of kids jumping up and down on our sensors getting quite a good workout (one kid was jumping for 10 minutes straight and got the high score for the weekend). Overall, seeing all the users really enjoy playing and struggling with flappy bird with their feet made the month of development totally worth it.
